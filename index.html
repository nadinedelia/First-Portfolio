  <h2>ABOUT ME</h2><br>
  <p>Hi, I’m Nadine and I’m 27 years old.
I come originally from Switzerland, but I moved to London in 2014 to become a professional dancer.<br>
Studying dance at University of course taught me nothing related to tech, but indeed many things that will be very useful in life – How to think creatively and how to collaborate for example. And of course a lot of discipline, ambition and perseverance.
No matter how many error messages I will get or how many times my code won’t work, I can promise you that I won’t give up. I might be screaming at my terminal for a while (don’t we all sometimes?), but I'll definitely keep on moving and will never ever give up.
<br> <br>
Other things about me that are not related to coding or dance: <br>
<br>
•	I speak 4.5 languages<br>
•	I travelled to 30+ countries <br>
•	I’m a minimalist<br>
•	I’m a yoga teacher and Personal Trainer (free classes for everyone, yay!) <br>
•	I somehow managed to do a 10-day silent meditation Vipassana retreat in India.. <br>
	  (still no clue how I survived that.. yeah, I'm stubborn.)<br>

  <h2>WHY CODING?</h2><br>
  <p>Coming from an academic family of engineers and computer scientists, I was always quite tech-savvy, to the point where I taught myself some basic 90's style HTML, CSS, PHP and pretty much the whole Adobe Creative Suite during my early teenage years. I think I was building my first website at the age of 11 – which of course looked like a car crash – but hey, who cares, it was fun! <br>
	  <br>
	  Coding was always fascinating to me – I love to solve puzzles and to challenge myself to find the right solution to a problem. What also intrigues me a lot is the fact that nowadays code and algorithms are everywhere. To understand code gives you a completely new level of knowledge of how the world works; an insight which I aspire to have.
As a creative and sports professional, I understand the vast possibilities this field could have uses for – the ability to merge tech, art and movement based science for those within the sports industry is something that one (/I) could only dream of. 

I see computing and programming not as a rigid and dry subject, but indeed as something very resourceful. In the end, it’s still creation – especially web design. Creation and design that enriches our daily lives.
